abstract = {Background: The post mortem external examination is the final service that a physician can render to a patient. Its purpose is not just to establish medical diagnoses, but to provide facts in the service of the judicial process and the public interest. Its main tasks are the definitive ascertainment of death, determination of the cause of death and assessment of the manner of death. Methods: Selective search and review of relevant literature on cause-of- death statistics, judicial principles, and the performance of the post mortem examination, with emphasis on determination of the cause and manner of death. Results and discussion: An important duty of the physician performing the post mortem external examination is to know the patient's history. Thus, in principle, the treating physician is the most suitable person to perform the post mortem examination. In most cases of death (perhaps 60{\%} to 70{\%}), the treating physician will be able to give reliable information on the patient's underlying illnesses and the cause of death, based on the patient's history and circumstances at the time of death. Problems arise when death is unexpected and the post mortem external examination alone does not suffice to establish the cause of death. If the cause of death cannot be determined, this fact should be documented, and the manner of death should likewise be documented as undetermined. The autopsy rate in Germany is less than 5{\%} of all deaths, which is very low.},

This approach originating in some industrialized countries has so far been neglected in Croatia in spite of previous experiences and existence of sociomedical tradition. The possible explanations are considered. Obvious health problems related to the standard of living, poverty, high unemployment, work insecurity, unjustified inequality of income, and other forms of discrimination in health are not tackled. The social determinants important for health are defined and at least five categories identified, i. e. broad cultural and economic circumstances, structural determinants and social position, intermediate determinants reflected in lifestyles, available social network and social capital, and finally discrimination in health care are recommended to include in epidemiological research and design of health interventions. The following measures are proposed as necessary in the current situation: 1) changes in scope and orientation of epidemiological and clinical research; 2) intensification of information for the public, experts and politicians on the role of social determinants; and 3) amplification of health interventions avoiding patterns of the predominant neoliberal approaches (blaming the victim), as well as administrative egalitarian approaches (teaching people to become victims waiting for elderly brother to provide solutions).},

abstract = {Cost-effectiveness thresholds are important decision rules that determine whether health interventions represent good value for money. In low- and middle-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) one to three times per capita gross domestic product (GDP) per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted has been the most widely used threshold for informing resource allocation decisions. However, in 2016, the WHO withdrew recommendations for using this threshold, creating a significant vacuum in South Africa and many countries that rely on results of cost-effectiveness analyses for making resource allocation decisions. This study estimates a cost-effectiveness threshold that reflects the health opportunity cost of health spending in South Africa using a three-step approach. First, marginal returns to health spending was estimated as health spending elasticity for crude death rates using a fixed effect estimation approach. Second, the opportunity cost of health spending was estimated as DALYs averted. Finally, a cost per DALY averted threshold was estimated as the inverse of the marginal product of health spending. We show that 1{\%} of total health spending in 2015 (equivalent to approximately ZAR 1.54 billion/USD 120.7 million) averted 1050 deaths, 34 180 years of life lost, 5880 years lived with disability and 40 055 DALYs. The cost-effectiveness threshold was estimated at approximately ZAR 38 500 (USD 3015) per DALY averted, ∼53{\%} of South Africa's per capita GDP in 2015 (ZAR 72 700/USD 5700) and lower than the previously recommended one to three times per capita GDP. As South Africa moves towards implementing universal health coverage reforms through National Health Insurance by 2025, the adoption of a threshold that reflects health opportunity costs will be crucial for ensuring efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources. This study provides useful insight into the magnitude of the health opportunity cost of health spending in South Africa and highlights the need for further research.},

abstract = {Background: Health technology assessment has been increasingly used in China, having been legally mandated in 2019, to inform reimbursement decisions and price negotiations between the National Healthcare Security Administration and pharmaceutical companies around the price of new pharmaceuticals. The criteria currently used to judge cost effectiveness and inform pricing negotiations, 3 × GDP per capita, is based on the rule of thumb previously recommended by the World Health Organization rather than an estimate based on an empirical assessment of health opportunity costs. Objective: The objective of this study was to inform a cost-effectiveness threshold for health technology assessment in China that accounts for health opportunity cost. Methods: The elasticity of health outcomes with respect to health expenditure was estimated using variations across 30 provincial-level administrative divisions in 2017 controlling for a range of other factors and using an instrumental variable approach to account for endogeneity to assess robustness of results. The estimated elasticity was then used to calculate the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted by variations in Chinese health expenditure at the margin. Results: The range estimated from this study, 27,923–52,247 (2017 RMB) (central estimate 37,446) per DALY averted or 47–88{\%} of GDP per capita (central estimate 63{\%}), shows that a cost per DALY averted cost-effectiveness threshold that reflects health opportunity costs is below 1 × GDP per capita. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the current cost-effectiveness threshold used in China is too high; continuing to use it risks decisions that reduce overall population health.},

To this aim, we combine claims data, mortality data and quality of life questionnaires from 2012 to 2014 for 11,000 patient groups to obtain quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) outcomes and spending. Using a fixed effects translog model, we estimate that a 1{\%} increase in hospital spending on average increases QALY outcomes by 0.2{\%}. This implies a threshold of €73,600 per QALY, with 95{\%} confidence intervals ranging from €53,000 to €94,000 per QALY.

Founding these estimates on robust empirical analysis can inform these decisions and improve allocative efficiency. This article estimates the annual marginal productivity of the English NHS over a 10-year period (between 2003 and 2012). Methods: Data on expenditure and mortality by program budget category are used in conjunction with socioeconomic and demographic variables from the censuses for 2001 and 2011. This article applies an econometric strategy that employs an established instrumental variable approach, which is then subjected to a number of sensitivity analyses. The results of the econometric analysis, along with additional data on the burden of disease, are used to generate an estimate of the marginal productivity for each of the study years. Results: We find that an additional unit of health benefit has cost between {\pounds}5000 and {\pounds}15 000 per quality-adjusted life-year from 2003 to 2012. Over this period these estimates (all in current prices) have increased at a faster rate than NHS price inflation, suggesting an increase in real terms.

@article{Ochalek2020,
abstract = {Purpose: Evaluating whether a new health technology provides good value for money requires an assessment of its opportunity cost. If the opportunity cost of the new health technology exceeds the benefits, however measured, a net loss is produced. Value frameworks using economic evaluation methods have been developed to guide the assessment of the value of new technologies within health care in response to rising spending. However, few explicitly consider health opportunity costs and fewer still base health opportunity costs on empirical estimates. This may partly be due to the dearth of estimates available, with only a handful of countries having estimates based on within-country data. To fill this gap, this study provides estimates of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for 33 high-income countries and the remaining Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and BRIICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa). Methods: Cost per DALY averted for each country was based on estimated elasticities of the health effects of changes in expenditure on health outcomes from applying an existing published econometric model that uses cross-country data to an expanded dataset and other existing elasticities drawn from selected UK within-country studies to country-level data on health expenditure, demographic characteristics, and burden of ill health. To provide a comprehensive picture of the state of research around empirical estimates of health opportunity costs for these countries, results from this study are reported against previously published estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the same countries. Findings: All but one of the ranges estimated fall below 3× the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the upper end of the widely applied range of 1–3× GDP per capita. The range of estimates based on applying an existing published econometric model that uses cross-country data to an expanded dataset are higher than when cost per DALY averted is calculated from other existing elasticities of the health effects of changes in expenditure drawn from selected UK within-country studies. They also tend to be higher than published estimates of cost per QALY gained. Implications: This study provides placeholder cost per DALY averted estimates that reflect health opportunity costs for 33 high-income countries and the remaining OECD and BRIICS countries. These estimates can be used to estimate the health opportunity costs of government health care expenditure until country-specific health opportunity cost are estimated using within-country data.},

abstract = {Background Cost-effectiveness analysis can guide policymakers in resource allocation decisions. It assesses whether the health gains offered by an intervention are large enough relative to any additional costs to warrant adoption. When there are constraints on the health care system's budget or ability to increase expenditures, additional costs imposed by interventions have an “opportunity cost” in terms of the health foregone because other interventions cannot be provided. Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) are typically used to assess whether an intervention is worthwhile and should reflect health opportunity cost. Nevertheless, CETs used by some decision makers—such as the World Health Organization that suggested CETs of 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—do not. Objectives To estimate CETs based on opportunity cost for a wide range of countries. Methods We estimated CETs based on recent empirical estimates of opportunity cost (from the English National Health Service), estimates of the relationship between country GDP per capita and the value of a statistical life, and a series of explicit assumptions. Results CETs for Malawi (the country with the lowest income in the world), Cambodia (with borderline low/low-middle income), El Salvador (with borderline low-middle/upper-middle income), and Kazakhstan (with borderline high-middle/high income) were estimated to be {\$}3 to {\$}116 (1{\%}–51{\%} GDP per capita), {\$}44 to {\$}518 (4{\%}–51{\%}), {\$}422 to {\$}1967 (11{\%}–51{\%}), and {\$}4485 to {\$}8018 (32{\%}–59{\%}), respectively. Conclusions To date, opportunity-cost-based CETs for low-/middle-income countries have not been available. Although uncertainty exists in the underlying assumptions, these estimates can provide a useful input to inform resource allocation decisions and suggest that routinely used CETs have been too high.},

abstract = {The economic evaluation of healthcare interventions requires an assessment of whether the improvement in health outcomes they offer exceeds the improvement in health that would have been possible if the additional resources required had, instead, been made available for other healthcare activities. Therefore, some assessment of these health opportunity costs is required if the best use is to be made of the resources available for healthcare. This paper provides a framework for generating country-specific estimates of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted ‘thresholds' that reflect health opportunity costs. We apply estimated elasticities on mortality, survival, morbidity and a generic measure of health, DALYs, that take account of measures of a country's infrastructure and changes in donor funding to country-specific data on health expenditure, epidemiology and demographics to determine the likely DALYs averted from a 1{\%} change in expenditure on health. The resulting range of cost per DALY averted ‘threshold' estimates for each country that represent likely health opportunity costs tend to fall below the range previously suggested by WHO of 1–3× gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The 1–3× GDP range and many other previous and existing recommendations about which interventions are cost-effective are not based on an empirical assessment of the likely health opportunity costs, and as a consequence, the health effects of changes in health expenditure have tended to be underestimated, and there is a risk that interventions regarded as cost-effective reduce rather than improve health outcomes overall.},

abstract = {Background: Spending on new healthcare technologies increases net population health when the benefits of a new technology are greater than their opportunity costs—the benefits of the best alternative use of the additional resources required to fund a new technology. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of increased government health expenditure as an empirical estimate of the average opportunity costs of decisions to fund new health technologies. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is proposed as a reference ICER to inform value-based decision making in Australia. Methods: Empirical top-down approaches were used to estimate the QALY effects of government health expenditure with respect to reduced mortality and morbidity. Instrumental variable two-stage least-squares regression was used to estimate the elasticity of mortality-related QALY losses to a marginal change in government health expenditure. Regression analysis of longitudinal survey data representative of the general population was used to isolate the effects of increased government health expenditure on morbidity-related, QALY gains. Clinical judgement informed the duration of health-related quality-of-life improvement from the annual increase in government health expenditure. Results: The base-case reference ICER was estimated at AUD28,033 per QALY gained. Parametric uncertainty associated with the estimation of mortality- and morbidity-related QALYs generated a 95{\%} confidence interval AUD20,758–37,667. Conclusion: Recent public summary documents suggest new technologies with ICERs above AUD40,000 per QALY gained are recommended for public funding. The empirical reference ICER reported in this article suggests more QALYs could be gained if resources were allocated to other forms of health spending.},

abstract = {The relationship between aging, health and healthcare expenditures is of central importance to academics and public policy makers. Generally, it is observed that, with advancing age, health deteriorates and healthcare expenditures increase. This seems to imply that increases in life expectancy would strongly increase both the demand for healthcare expenditures and the number of years lived in poor health. Previous research has shown that such straightforward conclusions may be flawed. For example, it has been established that not age but ‘time to death' is the main driver of increased healthcare expenditures at advanced ages. The paper extends this line of research by investigating the relationship between age, time to death and health, the last being longitudinally measured via a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. We propose an approach for modelling the health-related quality-of-life outcome that accounts for both the non-standard nature of this response variable (e.g. bounded, left skewed or heteroscedastic) and the panel structure of the data. Analyses were performed within a Bayesian framework. We found that health losses are centred in the final phase of life, which indicates that future increases in longevity will not necessarily increase life years spent in poor health. This may alleviate the consequences of population aging.},

By using health survey data on QoL for the general Dutch population linked to the mortality registry, we quantify the magnitude of this relationship. For addressing specific features of the nonstandard QoL distribution such as boundness, skewness, and heteroscedasticity, we modeled QoL using a generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) with a $\beta$ inflated outcome distribution. Our empirical results indicate that QoL decreases when approaching death, suggesting that there is a strong relationship between TTD and QoL. Predictions of different regression models revealed that ignoring this relationship results in an underestimation of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for preventive interventions. The underestimation ranged between 3{\%} and 7{\%} and depended on age, the number of years gained from the intervention, and the discount rate used.},

abstract = {Background: Heart failure is a major and growing medical and economic problem worldwide as 1-2{\%} of the healthcare budget are spent for heart failure. The prevalence of heart failure has increased over the past decades and it is expected that there will be further raise due to the higher proportion of elderly in the western societies. In this context cost-of-illness studies can significantly contribute to a better understanding of the drivers and problems which lead to the increasing costs in heart failure. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of published cost-of-illness studies related to heart failure to highlight the increasing cost impact of heart failure. Methods: A systematic review was conducted from 2004 to 2016 to identify cost-of-illness studies related to heart failure, searching PubMed (Medline), Cochrane, Science Direct (Embase), Scopus and CRD York Database. Results: Of the total of 16 studies identified, 11 studies reported prevalence-based estimates, 2 studies focused on incidence-based data and 3 articles presented both types of cost data. A large variation concerning cost components and estimates can be noted. Only three studies estimated indirect costs. Most of the included studies have shown that the costs for hospital admission are the most expensive cost element. Estimates for annual prevalence-based costs for heart failure patients range from {\$}868 for South Korea to {\$}25,532 for Germany. The lifetime costs for heart failure patients have been estimated to {\$}126.819 per patient. Conclusions: Our review highlights the considerable and growing economic burden of heart failure on the health care systems. The cost-of-illness studies included in this review show large variations in methodology used and the cost results vary consequently. High quality data from cost-of-illness studies with a robust methodology applied can inform policy makers about the major cost drivers of heart failure and can be used as the basis of further economic evaluations.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies reporting on the cost-effectiveness of cancer screening usually account for quality of life losses and healthcare costs owing to cancer but do not account for future costs and quality of life losses related to competing risks. This study aims to demonstrate the impact of medical costs and quality of life losses of other diseases in the life years gained on the cost-effectiveness of U.S. cancer screening. Methods: Cost-effectiveness studies of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the U.S. were identified using a systematic literature review. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the eligible articles were updated by adding lifetime expenditures and health losses per quality-adjusted life year gained because of competing risks. This was accomplished using data on medical spending and quality of life by age and disease from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2011–2015) combined with cause-deleted life tables. The study was conducted in 2018. Results: The impact of quality of life losses and healthcare expenditures of competing risks in life years gained incurred owing to screening were the highest for breast cancer and the lowest for cervical cancer. The updates suggest that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are underestimated by {\$}10,300–{\$}13,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained if quality of life losses and healthcare expenditures of competing risks are omitted in economic evaluations. Furthermore, cancer screening programs that were considered cost saving, were found not to be so following the inclusion of medical expenditures of competing risks. Conclusions: Practical difficulties in quantifying quality of life losses and healthcare expenditures owing to competing risks in life years gained can be overcome. Their inclusion can have a substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness of cancer screening programs.},

@article{Heijink2008,
abstract = {Objectives: To assess international comparability of general cost of illness (COI) studies and to examine the extent to which COI estimates differ and why. Methods: Five general COI studies were examined. COI estimates were classified by health provider using the system of health accounts (SHA). Provider groups fully included in all studies and matching SHA estimates were selected to create a common data set. In order to explain cost differences descriptive analyses were carried out on a number of determinants. Results: In general similar COI patterns emerged for these countries, despite their health care system differences. In addition to these similarities, certain significant disease-specific differences were found. Comparisons of nursing and residential care expenditure by disease showed major variation. Epidemiological explanations of differences were hardly found, whereas demographic differences were influential. Significant treatment variation appeared from hospital data. Conclusions: A systematic analysis of COI data from different countries may assist in comparing health expenditure internationally. All cost data dimensions shed greater light on the effects of health care system differences within various aspects of health care. Still, the study's objectives can only be reached by a further improvement of the SHA, by international use of the SHA in COI studies and by a standardized methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding the age pattern of medical spending and changes therein - the purpose of this paper - is essential in an ageing society. We started by combining several data sources to create a comprehensive time-based data series of hospital spending by age group, gender and disease category for The Netherlands in the period 1994-2010. Subsequently, this time series enabled us to disentangle changes in the age pattern of hospital spending to various disease categories. Finally, we investigated to what extent trends in hospital spending by age and disease differed under the different hospital payment schemes - first global and fee-for-service budgeting and then patient-based budgeting - that were in place in The Netherlands between 1994 and 2010. Our results show that while hospital spending increased for all age groups, it grew most for the non-elderly aged. The greatest hospital spending growth for this age group related to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Furthermore, compared to global budget in 1990s, overall hospital spending grew considerably under fee-for-service and patient-based payment schemes, although this effect appears to be disease-specific.},

@article{Claxton2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis involves the comparison of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new technology, which is more costly than existing alternatives, with the cost-effectiveness threshold. This indicates whether or not the health expected to be gained from its use exceeds the health expected to be lost elsewhere as other health-care activities are displaced. The threshold therefore represents the additional cost that has to be imposed on the system to forgo 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of health through displacement. There are no empirical estimates of the cost-effectiveness threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: (1) To provide a conceptual framework to define the cost-effectiveness threshold and to provide the basis for its empirical estimation. (2) Using programme budgeting data for the English NHS, to estimate the relationship between changes in overall NHS expenditure and changes in mortality. (3) To extend this mortality measure of the health effects of a change in expenditure to life-years and to QALYs by estimating the quality-of-life (QoL) associated with effects on years of life and the additional direct impact on QoL itself. (4) To present the best estimate of the cost-effectiveness threshold for policy purposes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Earlier econometric analysis estimated the relationship between differences in primary care trust (PCT) spending, across programme budget categories (PBCs), and associated disease-specific mortality. This research is extended in several ways including estimating the impact of marginal increases or decreases in overall NHS expenditure on spending in each of the 23 PBCs. Further stages of work link the econometrics to broader health effects in terms of QALYs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The most relevant 'central' threshold is estimated to be {\pounds}12,936 per QALY (2008 expenditure, 2008-10 mortality). Uncertainty analysis indicates that the probability that the threshold is {\textless} {\pounds}20,000 per QALY is 0.89 and the probability that it is {\textless} {\pounds}30,000 per QALY is 0.97. Additional 'structural' uncertainty suggests, on balance, that the central or best estimate is, if anything, likely to be an overestimate. The health effects of changes in expenditure are greater when PCTs are under more financial pressure and are more likely to be disinvesting than investing. This indicates that the central estimate of the threshold is likely to be an overestimate for all technologies which impose net costs on the NHS and the appropriate threshold to apply should be lower for technologies which have a greater impact on NHS costs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: The central estimate is based on identifying a preferred analysis at each stage based on the analysis that made the best use of available information, whether or not the assumptions required appeared more reasonable than the other alternatives available, and which provided a more complete picture of the likely health effects of a change in expenditure. However, the limitation of currently available data means that there is substantial uncertainty associated with the estimate of the overall threshold.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The methods go some way to providing an empirical estimate of the scale of opportunity costs the NHS faces when considering whether or not the health benefits associated with new technologies are greater than the health that is likely to be lost elsewhere in the NHS. Priorities for future research include estimating the threshold for subsequent waves of expenditure and outcome data, for example by utilising expenditure and outcomes available at the level of Clinical Commissioning Groups as well as additional data collected on QoL and updated estimates of incidence (by age and gender) and duration of disease. Nonetheless, the study also starts to make the other NHS patients, who ultimately bear the opportunity costs of such decisions, less abstract and more 'known' in social decisions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research-Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme.},

@article{Caro2018,
abstract = {The economic evaluation of new health technologies to assess whether the value of the expected health benefits warrants the proposed additional costs has become an essential step in making novel interventions available to patients. This assessment of value is problematic because there exists no natural means to measure it. One approach is to assume that society wishes to maximize aggregate health, measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Commonly, a single 'cost-effectiveness' threshold is used to gauge whether the intervention is sufficiently efficient in doing so. This approach has come under fire for failing to account for societal values that favor treating more severe illness and ensuring equal access to resources, regardless of pre-existing conditions or capacity to benefit. Alternatives involving expansion of the measure of benefit or adjusting the threshold have been proposed and some have advocated tacking away from the cost per QALY entirely to implement therapeutic area-specific efficiency frontiers, multicriteria decision analysis or other approaches that keep the dimensions of benefit distinct and value them separately. In this paper, each of these alternative courses is considered, based on the experiences of the authors, with a view to clarifying their implications.},

@article{VanBaal2019,
abstract = {Traditionally, threshold levels of cost-effectiveness have been derived from willingness-to-pay studies, indicating the consumption value of health (v-thresholds). However, it has been argued that v-thresholds need to be supplemented by so-called k-thresholds, which are based on the marginal returns to health care. The objective of this research is to estimate a k-threshold based on the marginal returns to cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospital care in the Netherlands. To estimate a k-threshold for hospital care on CVD, we proceed in two steps: First, we estimate the impact of hospital spending on mortality using a Bayesian regression modelling framework, using data on CVD mortality and CVD hospital spending by age and gender for the period 1994-2010. Second, we use life tables in combination with quality of life data to convert these estimates into a k-threshold expressed in euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. Our base case estimate resulted in an estimate of 41,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In our sensitivity analyses, we illustrated how the incorporation of prior evidence into the estimation pushes estimates downwards. We conclude that our base case estimate of the k-threshold may serve as a benchmark value for decision making in the Netherlands as well as for future research regarding k-thresholds.},

abstract = {Background: For years, the state of Saxony-Anhalt has had one of the highest mortality rates from ischemic heart disease among all federal states in Germany. In this article, we provide an overview of the prevalence of known risk factors for ischemic heart disease across the German states and discuss possible artefacts in mortality statistics. Methods: On the basis of data from a selective literature review and from official statistics, we compare, if available, age-standardized prevalences of diabetes, obesity, increased waist circumference, metabolic syndrome, and cigarette smoking across the German states. We also present statistics on completion of schooling, dropping out of school, and unemployment. Results: Saxony-Anhalt was in first or second place among German states for all of the risk factors considered. It was also among the leaders in the percentage of school dropouts (14.1{\%}), and, in 2011, it had the lowest percentage of persons educated to matriculation level (19.2{\%}). The unemployment rate in Saxony-Anhalt was 11.5{\%} in 2012, one of the highest rates in Germany. Even after unclear and unknown causes of death are taken into account, the high mortality from ischemic heart disease in Saxony-Anhalt (153.3 per 100 000 person years cannot be attributed completely to an artefact. Conclusion: The high prevalence of risk factors and the unfavorable profile of social factors are consistent with the observed high mortality from ischemic heart disease in Saxony-Anhalt. There is an urgent need for lasting prevention strategies on all levels-societal, behavioral, and clinical.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease continues to be the single most common cause of death and to account for the largest single portion of treatment costs in Germany. Reliable data on regional differences in the frequency of cardio - vascular disease are important for the planning of targeted care structures and preventive measures. METHODS Pooled data from the German Health Update (GEDA), a nationwide telephone health survey conducted in 2009, 2010 and 2012 (n = 62 214) were used to estimate the lifetime prevalence of major cardiovascular disease (self-reported medical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, other coronary heart disease, stroke, or congestive heart failure) in each of the German federal states. The influence of sociodemographic factors on regional prevalence differences was examined in adjusted logistic regression analyses. Prevalences were compared with mortality rates from cardiovascular disease that were obtained from cause-of-death statistics. RESULTS The lifetime prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Germany ranged from 10.0{\%} in Baden-W¨rttemberg to 15.8{\%} in Saxony-Anhalt. After adjustment for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and size of the communities of residence, nine of the other 15 states had significantly higher prevalences than Baden-W¨rttemberg, with odds ratios ranging from 1.26 (Hesse) to 1.55 (Saxony-Anhalt). Four of the five states that previously constituted the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) had above-average figures for prevalence and mortality. CONCLUSION There are relevant differences among the German federal states in the lifetime prevalence of major cardiovascular disease, which are only partly accounted for by differences in age and sex distribution, socioeconomic status, and community size.},
