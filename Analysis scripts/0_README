Plenty of descriptive analyses based on clean_data.rda:

03_ Contains scripts for generating graphs. Final graph scripts need to be pasted into manuscript.Rmd


Preparation of regression models:

04_prep_regression Runs baseline panel data models

04_prep_regression_collapse_state_test Reshapes data and runs regression on country level


The finale descriptive and regression output as shown in the manuscript.pdf is creating using manuscript.Rmd, which contains slightly altered figures and regressions


The two files starting with 

01_ 
02_ 

were used to extract information on collected data of the German DRG statistics and mortality statistics
